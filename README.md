## Problem Statement
Urban areas face *severe traffic congestion* leading to:
- Long waiting times at intersections  
- Increased fuel consumption & pollution  
- Slower emergency responses  
- Lack of *real-time adaptive traffic management*  

---

## Our Solution
*Smart TrafficFlow* provides:  
- *ML-based traffic prediction* (10–15 minutes ahead)  
- *Dynamic signal optimization* to reduce waiting times   
- *Traffic heatmaps* and a *simulation mode* for demos
